## What is different of the Code Interview Test Requirements

**The solution uses Angular + Typescript instead of React + Typescript**

**_Why:_**
I used React a long time ago but, I like Angular and know it better than React.
It was easier for me to implement SPA in short time.

## What was not implemented correctly

**Business may ask more validation in the future.**
The backend has a validation service that uses a public interface for each validator. It could be extended easily in the future.

The frontend has no ability for the extension. I don't have a ready solution for angular, but I'm sure it is exists. I needed more free time.

**TDOs are not excellent for the interaction FE and BE**
I was in a rush that is why my decision was so simple. DTO could be more readable and understandable.
